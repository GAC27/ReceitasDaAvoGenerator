This project is based of the inital work made on https://github.com/auino/cookidump . 

What this does is use the json generated by the cookidump project and convert it to a pdf format which makes you end up with an offline cooking book format. 

Right now the CookidooRecipe model is expecting it to have the properties in Portuguese since the cookidump project generates the json with the properties in the local language it takes it from but its just a matter of forking this repo and creating a new model. Feel free to do a PR to add this changes. 

This generates a console app which is quite self explanatory on how to use.
